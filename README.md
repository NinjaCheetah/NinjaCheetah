### hey there!
**I'm NinjaCheetah.** I'm a 17 (at the time of writing) year old programmer from the US. Throughout the years, I've done a bit of Visual Basic, C#, C, Python, Swift, Rust, HTML/CSS/JS, Batch Scripting, Bash Scripting, and even some Kotlin. I have a lot of old abandoned projects lying around here that date back to when I was still in my early days of programming.

My current focus is on developing for the Wii, though indirectly. C didn't stick for me, so instead of writing Homebrew for the Wii, I've taken to writing PC software to help with others' Wii modding antics. Much of the existing software is really aging at this point, and is designed for Windows-only, so I've taken to writing fresh software that's OS-independent (and then I get to benefit too as a Linux user!). My main project is [libWiiPy](https://github.com/NinjaCheetah/libWiiPy), a Python library desgined to eventually replace libWiiSharp, so that new Wii programs can be made in Python and therefore be entirely portable. I've started towards this goal with my other primary projects, [WiiPy](https://github.com/NinjaCheetah/WiiPy) and [NUSGet](https://github.com/NinjaCheetah/NUSGet). I'm also working on learning Rust for real, and I'm doing so by writing a Rust port of libWiiPy/WiiPy called [rustii](https://github.com/NinjaCheetah/rustii), which is still very experimental, but will hopefully have feature parity one day.
